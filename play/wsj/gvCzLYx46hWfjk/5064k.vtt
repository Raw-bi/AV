00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.390
<v Narrator>You're looking at the demographic breakdown</v>

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.210
of China and India's populations.

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.230
In 1990, both countries' demographics resembled a pyramid,

4
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.990
which meant that there were far more young people being born

5
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.550
than there were old people.

6
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.220
But fast forward to projections for 2050,

7
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.470
and you'll notice a dramatic change.

8
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.740
The Chinese pyramid narrows to resemble a shape more

9
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.673
like a funnel.

10
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.460
For more than two centuries,

11
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.340
China has had the largest population in the world.

12
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.910
This year, the UN said India will take its place.

13
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.580
India's population is expected to keep growing

14
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.140
for the next four decades,

15
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.370
peaking at nearly 1.7 billion in 2063.

16
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.640
China's population is projected to shrink rapidly.

17
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.200
By the start of the next century,

18
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.070
India's population is expected to be double that of China's.

19
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.561
<v ->All the science point</v>

20
00:00:51.561 --> 00:00:56.561
to a very challenging future for China demographically.

21
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.580
<v Narrator>Here's why this shift marks a watershed moment</v>

22
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.840
for both nations,

23
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.783
and what the change could mean for the global economy.

24
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.840
This year, China announced

25
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.680
its first population decline since 1961.

26
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.070
In 2020, China's fertility rate or the number

27
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.360
of children a woman has over her lifetime came in at 1.3,

28
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.670
which is one of the lowest in the world.

29
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.820
The roots of China's demographic crisis can be found

30
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.380
in its one child policy.

31
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.590
<v ->The policy was designed to keep birth low</v>

32
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.971
so that China would have the opportunity

33
00:01:31.971 --> 00:01:34.140
to grow its economy.

34
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.150
It turns out, in reality,

35
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.150
the one child policy has far more long-lasting impacts

36
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.740
than policymakers intended.

37
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.930
In a way, it worked too well.

38
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.460
<v Narrator>Starting in 1980,</v>

39
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.850
most Chinese couples were strictly limited to one child.

40
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.790
Despite reversing the one child policy in 2016,

41
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.760
China's fertility rate has continued to decline.

42
00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.310
<v ->The replacement rate needed</v>

43
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.790
to keep a population stable is 2.1.

44
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.350
<v Narrator>Meaning that a woman would need</v>

45
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.600
to give birth to at least two children

46
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.310
to keep the population stable

47
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.590
and essentially, replace the parents.

48
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.960
With a fertility rate of 2.0,

49
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.970
India's fertility rate is slightly lower

50
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.230
than the replacement rate.

51
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.360
<v ->The reason why India's population</v>

52
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.460
is projected to keep growing

53
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.880
for several more decades is because India, unlike China,

54
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.730
still has a very large group of women

55
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.630
of reproductive age that's very different from China.

56
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.520
<v Narrator>In China, the one child policy</v>

57
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.920
produced a dramatic gender imbalance

58
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.960
that originated in strong cultural

59
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.750
and social preferences for male children.

60
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.422
In 2021, the number of marriage registrations plummeted

61
00:02:43.422 --> 00:02:45.150
to 7.6 million,

62
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.430
the lowest since the government started keeping records

63
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.470
in the mid-1980s.

64
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.830
The global economy has grown to rely on China's vast pool

65
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.500
of factory workers for manufactured goods

66
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.140
and its consumers represent a growing market

67
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.780
for Western made cars and luxury goods.

68
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.630
<v ->A declining Chinese population would mean</v>

69
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.680
that there will be fewer workers to make products

70
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.410
that are exported to other countries

71
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.720
and there will be fewer consumers,

72
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.280
especially younger consumers

73
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.030
to buy goods from other countries.

74
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.290
<v Narrator>In the coming decades,</v>

75
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.440
demographers expect China will face a huge worker

76
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.730
to retiree gap.

77
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.730
In 2020, 14% of China's population was over 64 years old.

78
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.940
While in India, just 7% of people were over 64.

79
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.540
By 2070, nearly 59% of people

80
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.970
in China will be over the age of 64.

81
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.130
While in India, only 30%

82
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.830
of the population will be in the same age bracket.

83
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.770
<v ->A larger group of retirees will mean</v>

84
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.560
that younger Chinese people will have a bigger

85
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.080
of a burden to support the elderly.

86
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.410
That's especially true in the rural areas.

87
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.400
<v Narrator>In some ways,</v>

88
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.740
India looks like China did 30 years ago.

89
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.590
It has a rapidly expanding working age population

90
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.860
with 610 million people under age 25

91
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.950
and relatively few older people to care for.

92
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.440
India's rising population means it's likely

93
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.740
to keep its economy growing, buy more of the world's goods

94
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.380
and play a bigger role in global affairs.

95
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.960
But India's rise isn't assured.

96
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.390
<v ->India's problem now is all about jobs.</v>

97
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.470
Yes, it does have a large working age population

98
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.910
but at the same time,

99
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.440
it is struggling to create jobs for its young people.

100
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.660
<v Narrator>India is primarily a rural nation</v>

101
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.570
and still lags behind China in urbanization.

102
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.300
Unlike China, where millions of migrant laborers move

103
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.090
to cities to work in factories, many Indians

104
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.580
are reluctant to leave their hometowns.

105
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.430
India also significantly lags behind China

106
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.613
in terms of female labor participation.

107
00:04:49.613 --> 00:04:52.140
India's cultural norms have meant that families

108
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.790
who can afford to keep their daughters

109
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.220
and wives at home prefer to do so.

110
00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.610
<v ->When Mao took power, he really pushed the idea</v>

111
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.620
that women is equal to men.

112
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.453
For a long time,

113
00:05:02.453 --> 00:05:06.300
China's women labor participation rate has been very high

114
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.960
and for India, that seem to be not the case.

115
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.690
<v Narrator>Whatever happens, the world's future population</v>

116
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.000
will be tilted more towards the Global South

117
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.800
and South Asia in particular.

118
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.290
In 2060, the three successor states

119
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.940
to pre-independence India

120
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.190
will have 2.3 billion people

121
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.690
versus China's 1.2 billion, guaranteeing profound changes

122
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.528
to the global economy.

123
00:05:29.528 --> 00:05:32.195
(pensive music)
