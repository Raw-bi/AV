<v Narrator>Military communications, tech industry secrets,</v>

3
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.880
and maritime transmissions,

4
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.867
these are some of the communications that experts say,

5
00:00:07.867 --> 00:00:10.350
"May be intercepted by a new intelligence gathering

6
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.540
and military training facility in Cuba,

7
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.910
built in partnership with China."

8
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.770
Experts say, "China is trying to replicate

9
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.320
the US's global surveillance capabilities,

10
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.290
and Cuba could play a crucial role in that plan."

11
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.120
<v ->The US has always had the advantage</v>

12
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.400
because we've had the geography,

13
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.270
and that's why Cuba would be an important asset for China.

14
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.380
<v Narrator>So how does Cuba fit</v>

15
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.900
into China's global eavesdropping strategy?

16
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.030
And what do China's other spy base tell us

17
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.530
about how this one could look?

18
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.830
Both the US and China already operate

19
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.870
a number of listening posts around the world

20
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.680
as part of their signals intelligence or SIGINT Programs.

21
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.150
That's the process of eavesdropping

22
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.410
on the voice conversations,

23
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.170
text messages, emails, location signals,

24
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.590
and data transmissions that fly around the world constantly.

25
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.277
In June, US officials said,

26
00:00:57.277 --> 00:00:58.620
"China had reached an agreement

27
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.020
worth several billion dollars with Cuba,

28
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.760
the deal would allow the island nation

29
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.350
to build a new military facility

30
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.360
capable of electronic eavesdropping

31
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.640
100 miles from the Florida Keys."

32
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.370
Beijing and Havana have both denied the planned facility,

33
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.520
but US officials say, "China and Cuba already jointly run

34
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.980
for eavesdropping stations on the island.

35
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.960
And experts say, "This is just the latest chapter

36
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.380
in a long history of Cuba's eavesdropping capabilities."

37
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.890
<v ->Russia used Cuba for decades</v>

38
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.540
because it was the one place

39
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.570
that they could build a listening post

40
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.840
and collect a lot of the data from the United States.

41
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.610
<v Narrator>James Bamford has written five books</v>

42
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.010
on national security and intelligence agencies

43
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.830
and previously worked for PBS and ABC.

44
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.930
He says that, "A Chinese listening post on Cuba

45
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.490
would have a very clear mission."

46
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.870
<v ->One of the key things you wanna do</v>

47
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.510
is eavesdrop on satellites

48
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.110
because so much information is transmitted up to

49
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.080
and then downlinked from satellites.

50
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.980
<v Narrator>These satellites convey</v>

51
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.960
much of the world's military, diplomatic,

52
00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.490
and commercial information.

53
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.010
They orbit about 22,000 miles above the Earth

54
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.020
at a fixed point over the equator,

55
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.380
mostly above the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans.

56
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.150
Bamford says, "China has only been able to

57
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.850
tap into satellites over the Indian and Pacific Oceans,

58
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.620
from facilities in the Spratly Islands

59
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.090
and the Great Coco Island."

60
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.620
But listening into communications

61
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.770
over the Atlantic Ocean is where Cuba comes in.

62
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.840
<v ->I mean, the way the Chinese would do it,</v>

63
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.300
basically you need a very large area,

64
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.490
and you're building satellite dishes,

65
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.920
they could be 90 feet across,

66
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.060
and then you, a lot of times will put it in the radome,

67
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.520
which looks like a big golf ball covering,

68
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.990
both protecting it from the weather

69
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.190
and hiding the location of where you're targeting.

70
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.210
<v Narrator>These facilities can range</v>

71
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.670
from a single satellite dish to over a dozen.

72
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.110
Having more dishes allows the station

73
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.180
to target multiple satellites at once.

74
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.610
Bamford says, "One US listening post in Japan

75
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.580
can target 8,000 signals from 16 satellites."

76
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.830
<v ->That's a huge amount of data</v>

77
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.700
and you need a large number of satellites to do that.

78
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.860
And then once you've collected that,

79
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.930
you've also gotta demodulate it,

80
00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.390
you gotta, in other words, turn it from satellite data

81
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.820
into data that can be understandable.

82
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.680
<v Narrator>This large amount of data is then filtered</v>

83
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.590
to focus on specific types of communications.

84
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.390
Bamford says, "That unlike the US,

85
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.870
which mainly targets military and diplomatic communications,

86
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.870
China is primarily focused on commercial eavesdropping."

87
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.830
<v ->They really are interested in technology</v>

88
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.290
and there are enormous amounts

89
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.330
of technological communications

90
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.750
going back and forth to Silicon Valley and so forth.

91
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:34.680
<v Narrator>But satellite dishes</v>

92
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.240
aren't the only type of sensor

93
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.380
that China has established

94
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.660
in its other spy stations around the world.

95
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.950
This satellite imagery shows

96
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.780
a type of direction-finding apparatus

97
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.420
called an Elephant Cage or Wullenweber.

98
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.640
<v ->They're huge antennas,</v>

99
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.220
it could be a quarter mile across,

100
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.110
and they've got 360 elements, poles basically,

101
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.870
wires on 'em in a circle.

102
00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.040
And the whole idea is

103
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.250
when they're trying to listen for a signal,

104
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.650
that signal will hit one of those elements,

105
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.210
one of those wires,

106
00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.640
a millisecond before it hits another one.

107
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.460
And that way, they could tell what direction it is.

108
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.050
<v Narrator>This information is particularly useful</v>

109
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.820
for tracking maritime activity,

110
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.350
with Cuba strategically located

111
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.750
to pick up signals along the US East Coast.

112
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:19.890
<v ->So if they're trying to listen</v>

113
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.920
for an American submarine in that area,

114
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.240
and the submarine comes up

115
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.280
and it sends a burst communication,

116
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.800
it'll be able to collect that information

117
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.720
and find out the direction,

118
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.160
and then they'll triangulate it

119
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.400
by having listing posts in other places

120
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.370
that have a similar type of antenna.

121
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.870
And then you can triangulate it,

122
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.990
and find out exactly where that submarine is.

123
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.330
<v Narrator>As tensions between China and the US grow,</v>

124
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.910
intelligence gathering will continue to play a key role

125
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.670
in the diplomatic, military, and commercial rivalry

126
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.470
between the two nations.

127
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.210
And while experts say, "Cuba's spy bases

128
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.330
significantly improved China's eavesdropping capabilities,"

129
00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.980
US officials say, "They are confident

130
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.020
in their ability to meet their security commitments

131
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.411
in the US and abroad."

132
00:05:03.411 --> 00:05:05.994
