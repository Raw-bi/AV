1
00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.269
We're aboard a ship on a mission deep
into the heart of the South China Sea.

2
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.159
It's a days long journey

3
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.909
through some of the most contested
waters in the world. You can see how

4
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.159
close the Chinese Coast Guard is
getting to our vessel. It looks like

5
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.860
it's really about to hit us and it will
end

6
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.639
in one of the most significant
confrontations between China and the

7
00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:24.200
Philippines in recent years.

8
00:00:27.979 --> 00:00:31.530
For the first time, foreign journalists
have been invited to join a resupply

9
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.950
mission traveling over 100 nautical
miles to a remote military outpost.

10
00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:38.759
That's at the center of a fierce
dispute between China and the

11
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.990
Philippines. We're on board the BRP
Cobra, one of two Coast Guard ships

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.479
traveling from Palawan Island to meet
two small supply boats. The Coast

13
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.139
Guard's plan is to escort the supply
vessels from Sabina Shoal to Second

14
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.310
Thomas Shoal. The journey is taking us
through China's nine dash line marking

15
00:00:56.319 --> 00:01:00.680
Beijing's expansive claims to the sea.
Our destination is a reef. Both China

16
00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:02.349
and the Philippines claim as their own.

17
00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.750
Manila deliberately grounded the Sierra
Madre. A World War Two airship here in

18
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.830
1999 to stake its claim to the area. A
permanent contingent of Filipino

19
00:01:14.839 --> 00:01:19.389
Marines is stationed on the rusting
dilapidated wreckage missions to

20
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.750
resupply the Sierra Madre have grown
increasingly dangerous as China

21
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.730
attempts to prevent the resupply boats
from reaching their destination.

22
00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:32.550
Just hours into our voyage. It's clear
our convoy has been spotted. There's a

23
00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:37.069
helicopter flying overhead, it went
past us a few minutes ago towards the

24
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.319
other Philippine coast guard boat then
turned around. This is a Chinese Navy

25
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.779
helicopter. It's the first sign we've
seen so far that the Chinese are aware

26
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:46.500
that we're here

27
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.690
under the cover of darkness. We arrive
at Sabina Shoal, the rendezvous point.

28
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.419
We've just met up with the supply boats.
There's one just behind me and another

29
00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.559
one over there and now we're making our
way towards Second Thomas Shoal. In the

30
00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:06.050
dead of night, the Chinese Coast Guard
starts to shadow our fleet by dawn.

31
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.729
We're surrounded. The Chinese vessels

32
00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:14.539
are on, they're getting really close to
us. This is Chinese Coast Guard vessel

33
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.970
3305.

34
00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:20.809
The Chinese fleet begins to encircle
our ship preventing us from getting

35
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.869
close to the supply boat. Our boat is
sort of turning away now because you

36
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.460
can see how close the Chinese Coast
Guard is getting to our

37
00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:32.809
a short distance away. The crew aboard
the other Philippine Coast Guard

38
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.839
vessels scramble as a Chinese ship
collides into its bow.

39
00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:41.729
The Chinese fleet takes positions
around our convoy veering close to

40
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.110
block the entrance to the reef fleets
of fishing vessels controlled by the

41
00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:50.259
Chinese coast Guard move into place.
This is China's Maritime Militia in

42
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.339
action. We're now completely surrounded
by Chinese vessels. Some of them are

43
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.470
Chinese Coast Guard and some of them
are Chinese flag fishing vessels that

44
00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:59.729
appear to be part of its maritime
Militia.

45
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.759
One of the Filipino supply boats has
become separated from its protection as

46
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.600
it tries to break through the Chinese
fleet.

47
00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:10.699
The small boat is surrounded and
blasted with water cannons from two

48
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.380
Chinese coast guard ships. The cannons
smash into the bridge,

49
00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:20.110
shattering windows and injuring those
inside, forcing the boat to turn back.

50
00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:25.169
Finally, the remaining supply boat
manages to break through the Chinese

51
00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:28.990
line, sailing through the blocking
ships to deliver its crucial supplies

52
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.529
to the marines aboard Sierra Madre.
Hours after the standoff began,

53
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.309
China's coast guard would later say
that its actions were to curtail what

54
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.270
it called. The Philippine vessel's
intrusion into the waters around the

55
00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:43.110
reef and that it allowed the supply
vessel to pass

56
00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:48.800
as our convoy makes its way back to the
island of Palawan. We are constantly

57
00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:52.740
shadowed by a Chinese vessel as
encounters in the sea grow more

58
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.419
aggressive. So too do the risks of
these confrontations spilling over into

59
00:03:56.429 --> 00:03:57.990
something much more dangerous.
