00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.000
next year I've been there five times in
我交谈过的人中，没有人

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.120
all of the great cities of Taiwan and
因为他们的感觉而想要重新加入或与中国统一。

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.040
what I've noticed most conspicuously is

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.959
that nobody I've talked to wants to

00:10:13.959 --> 00:10:17.120
rejoin or reunify with China because of
所以我认为，如果

你对

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.680
self-determination so I think that if
自决和自由的渴望更重要，那么

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.279
you're going to say our sovereignty
你所做的事情不会

00:10:24.279 --> 00:10:26.279
matters more than your desire for your
让你在台湾受欢迎， 你不会

00:10:26.279 --> 00:10:28.480
own self-determination and freedom then
赢得中国对该岛主权的争论

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.040
that China cannot should not be seen
但我在节目开始时问维克多

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.120
through a solely Western lens so I and I
有关日本、印度和

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.040

菲律宾分裂台湾的问题，只是

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.600
but I began the show by asking Victor
该地区的问题，你认为中国

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.120
about Japan and India and the
应对其中一些问题负责

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.800
Philippines separate Taiwan just the
所有这些问题 这些问题都不是，

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.800
issues in the region do you think China
中国显然

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.760
is responsible for some of those issues
不可避免地卷入了所有这些问题，嗯，我

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.680
all of those issues none of those issues
认为，呃，实际上，如果你看看

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.680
well China is obviously involved in
中国过去的崛起，你就会

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:05.000
inevitably in all of those issues um I
知道，这是我们历史上见过的 30 40 年来最大的巨大

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.200
think that uh that actually if you look
变化

世界上该地区的一切，呃，但这并

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.720

没有，但

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:21.360
and uh inevitably that is changing
我要说的关于中国R的值得注意的事情是你如何

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.040
everything in the region in the world uh
引用军事数据等等，

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.200
that doesn't but the remarkable thing
但中国自1979年以来没有打过任何战争，

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:30.040
I'd say Med about China's R is how you
如果 你将其与处于

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.000
quoted the military figures and so on
同一发展阶段的美国、欧洲、日本进行比较，

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.600
but China has not fought any wars since
他们

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:38.279
1979 if you compare that with America

新庄长期以来在

00:19:42.919 --> 00:19:45.960
situation in ch Shin Jang but clearly
河与汉之间的关系方面存在一个大问题，

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.919
there's been a big problem for a long
2009 年

00:19:48.919 --> 00:19:52.080
time in Shin Jang in terms of the
发生示威并造成 200

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.480
relationship between the weer and the
人死亡时，这一问题达到了顶峰。 那时

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:59.280
Han and that came to a head in 2009
中国人对中国造成了同样

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.159
when there was a demonstration and 200
的损害，所以这不是

00:20:02.159 --> 00:20:05.480
people were killed by by the weer then
这，在我看来，这是一个很深的问题，

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.799
the Chinese Chinese inflicted the same
而且不容易被忽视。

00:20:08.799 --> 00:20:11.880
kind of damage on the so this is not
中国没有其他

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.360
this is this is a deep problem in my
类似的问题，是的，但人们认为

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.720
view and it's not easily passed up
这是一个 相当大的问题，这对他们来说是一个非常

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.360
there's no other problem in China of
大的问题，是的，我做的

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:22.120

关于

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.600
big problem for them yeah and I do the
分离主义的观点是正确的，我认为

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:29.360
other thing bet I'd say is that um um
中国的 3000 万穆斯林是

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.240
the point that's being made about
他们拥有最大的单一少数派，

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.400

实际上在2020年和

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.480
China actually collided with reality and
2021年的两年里，中国确实做到了这一点 在这种

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.920

2021 actually China did under the
系统，现在讨论的问题之一，

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:37.680
circumstances extremely well and Well
我认为，呃呃，到目前为止，关于

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.800
outperformed the West and the reasons
这个问题是 呃，如果你说独裁者专制所有这些，这个国家

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.000
for it are quite complicated uh you've
听起来好像这个国家不起作用，

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.800
got to take into a very different kind

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:45.800
of system now one of the problems with
但如果你说不是你

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:49.160
the discussion I think uh uh so far on
个人，而是有人说没有

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:53.200
this question is that uh the country it
讨论，这是我认为这

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.119
sounds as if the country doesn't work if
绝对是不真实的，所以我们' 我们

00:36:55.119 --> 00:36:58.280
you say dictator despot all these
在这里展示的不是准确的

00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:01.599
I but if and and you say not you
图片，这不是关于

00:37:01.599 --> 00:37:04.560
personally but and one says there's no
准确的图片，而是关于平衡，

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:07.040
discussion this is I think this is
所以我不否认你

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:09.000
absolutely untrue so what we're
所说的，但你是英国人，你会

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.079
presenting here is not an accurate
认为这是一场政治地震，如果

00:37:11.079 --> 00:37:12.760
picture we've got it's not about
外交大臣和

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.119
accurate picture it's about balance
国防部长在六个月内失踪了，

00:37:14.119 --> 00:37:15.800

超越纸板剪裁，

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:31.920

并了解它是

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:35.040
odd certainly to our eyes it's we weird
