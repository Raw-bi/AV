00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.399
from Ukraine to Gaza the world seems

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.440
more divided and uncertain than it's

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:12.320
been for years Global powers and Western

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.759
alliances have been put to the test and

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.240
amid the turmoil China is rising to

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.359
challenge the world order Chinese

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.930
president Xi Jinping now in his third

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:24.980
term in office has high ambitions

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.980
[Music]

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.559
territorial disputes have sparked fears

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.320
of a larger conflict that could have

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.760
Regional and Global implications you

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.960
have approached the waters near Chinese

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.760
J including in the contested Waters of

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.719
the South China Sea your curse leave and

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.640
keep F over and in Taiwan where the

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.960
threat of a Chinese military Invasion

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.559
looms

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.559
larger meanwhile at home attacks on

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.239
basic freedoms and human rights have

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.200
become more severe like in Shin Jang

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.280
where China continues to commit serious

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.439
human rights abuses some say a genocide

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.000
against the weager Muslims so how far

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.799
will China's autocratic Vision reach and

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.479
will long simmering tension with the

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:21.479

China Victor gal thank you so much for

joining me on head-to head this evening

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.000
here in London thank you for having me

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.200
China has upped its military spending

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.480
it's expanding its nuclear Arsenal it

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.200
now has the biggest Navy in the world

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.920
Chinese president Xi Jinping has said

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.800
that the country's military should be

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.040
capable of quote fighting and winning

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.400
wars and told the military to focus all

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.920
your energy on fighting improve your

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.280
capability to win Victor who do you want

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.400
to fight and who do you want to win

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.159
against first of all the Chinese

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.120
military spending is the second largest

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:03.400
in the world but it is only a fraction

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:07.000
of that of the United States and China

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.480
has a very uh difficult geopolitical

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.640
situation China has 14 land and

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.799
neighboring countries all together and

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:18.720
six Maritime Nations uh for China

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:22.080
therefore China's defense defensive in

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.760
nature is not for fighting anyone except

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.239
those who want to invade China or to

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.599
launch a war against China China's

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.360
military spending is for peace rather

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:34.200
than war and War will be forced upon

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.599
China and China need to fight back you

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.120
say it's for peace but your neighbors

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.760
don't agree your neighbors are pretty

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.080
worried about you you go through the

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.680
list Japan has sounded the alarm saying

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.840
your military buildup is very serious

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.959
concern to them India is worried about

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.280
China on its border and the Philippines

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.720
president has warned that China is

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.840
becoming a more pronounced and worrisome

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.239
threat he says those are the elected

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.799
governments of countries representing

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.239
over 1.6 billion people in Asia this is

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.079
not the United States this is not the

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.439
West this is Asian neighbors saying

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.400
we're worried about China may you

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:07.560
mentioned the three of the neighboring

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.360
countries of China uh let's talk about

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.680
one of them one each of them very

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.760
quickly Japan unconditionally

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.479
surrendered not only to the United

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:22.079
States but also to China in

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:24.160
1945 and if you read very carefully the

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:27.280
unconditional surrender document that

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.120
Japan signed then you will know how

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.479
Japan need to conduct its foreign

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.400
affairs as well as its military troops

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.639
uh with China and with all those

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.360
countries that Japan unconditionally

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:41.919
surrendered for India is a great nation

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.240
and there is a territorial dispute

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:48.240
between China and India but that dispute

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:51.759
was not created by China neither was it

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:54.680
created by India it was created or left

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:56.800
behind by the British Indian uh

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.600
government that's great history lesson

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.759
but right now China in 24 the defense

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:06.360
spending is going up by 7% the most for

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:08.080
5 years you've had 29 consecutive years

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.400
of military expenditure growth the most

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.880
of any country in the world since 2022

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.039
China has increased military drills

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.039
around Taiwan it's escalated since the

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:18.319
new Taiwanese president was inaugurated

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:20.039
in May China is not a fan of him since

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:22.600
then there's been almost daily activity

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:24.759
involving China's warships drones cyber

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.440
attacks against Taiwan China is getting

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:30.560
ready to invade Taiwan isn't it there is

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.039
only one China Taiwan is part of China

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.039
and the government of the People's

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:38.120
Republic of China is the sole legitimate

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:40.960
government for the totality of China the

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.520
exact status between the two sides of

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.199
the Taiwan state is The Unfinished Civil

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.720
War back in

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:49.919
1949 so ever since the beginning of the

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.120
1980s China does not want to use a war

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:53.280
to solve this unification problem you

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.199
don't want to use a war but you're

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.880
surrounding it with ships drones cyber

00:05:55.199 --> 00:06:00.240
attacks and making lots of threats each

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.440
time when the separatists in Taiwan want

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.520
to push the edge of the envelope they

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:07.599
will come across more and more

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.160
demonstration of the commitment of the

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:13.240
Chinese Nation to eventually achieve

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.080
peaceful reunification or otherwise

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.800
that's the lious test your defense

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.080
minister said anyone who dares to pursue

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.720
independence for Taiwan will be crushed

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:24.800
into pieces and face destruction sounds

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:27.880
like a truly peaceful guy that's a real

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.960
statement because if the separatists if

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.599
the separatists really want to put P the

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.880
edge of the envelope with the aid of

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:37.800
some big country for example which wants

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:40.880
to use Taiwan as a proxy in its own

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:43.720
geopolitical rivalry against China then

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.919
wait until you see what will happen

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:48.639
reunification will be achieved and China

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:50.680
is the only permanent member of the

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:53.280
United Nations security Council which

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.639
has not yet achieved a complete

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.360
reunification what I'm what I I'm always

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:59.199
amused with this phrase reunification

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.599
because if it's one China that clearly

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:02.039
it's not One China clearly you're

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:03.919
accepting by definition if you need to

00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:06.680
reunify it they are doing their own

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:09.240
thing and why this obsession with Taiwan

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:11.479
you are a country of 3.7 million square

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.960
miles a population 60 times that of

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:16.080
Taiwan economy 20 times the size of

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:19.199
Taiwan why are you obsessed with Taiwan

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:21.680
why not just leave them be in terms of

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:24.639
Defending China's sovereignty and

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:28.400
territorial Integrity any inch of land

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:31.319
is not one inch too much any one single

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:34.120
person is not one one person too many so

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:35.280
we need to achieve reunification as even

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:38.039
though they don't want to be part of

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:40.759
your country 12% of the people of Taiwan

00:07:38.039 --> 00:07:42.919
say they want to reunify with China

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:45.680
12% you can't get more unpopular than

00:07:42.919 --> 00:07:48.280
that in thaty it's not up to the people

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.879
in Taiwan to decide about the one China

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:52.360
policy you're very blunt in your

00:07:49.879 --> 00:07:53.639
disregard for people's views freedoms

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.280
dignity you say that you don't care

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:56.520
about what they think you also said in

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:59.720
an interview with the French newspaper

00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:01.879
lemond once we get the island back we'll

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:04.280
have to ask everyone's Origins those who

00:08:01.879 --> 00:08:05.800
have Japanese ancestry who you basicly

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:08.240
say cons constitute 10% of the

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:10.879
population will have to pledge loyalty

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:13.479
to reunification and writing otherwise

00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:14.560
will'll have to help them leave you're

00:08:13.479 --> 00:08:16.919
basically calling for the ethnic

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:19.599
cleansing of 2.3 million people in

00:08:16.919 --> 00:08:22.120
Taiwan no you remember back in

00:08:19.599 --> 00:08:25.039
1945 when Japan unconditionally

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:28.120
surrendered a lot of people in Taiwan

00:08:25.039 --> 00:08:31.360
who originally came from Japan they were

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:34.080
the rulers of uh Taiwan at the time they

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:37.479
stay behind because of the magnanimity

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:40.760
of the Chinese Nation now several

00:08:37.479 --> 00:08:44.200
decades later they account for about 10%

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:46.240
of the local population in Taiwan now if

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:49.399
you really do your homework you will

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:52.720
realize that those Die Hard Taiwanese

00:08:49.399 --> 00:08:54.880
separatists include many of these

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.320
Japanese but okay but you would get rid

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.360
of them you would get rid of 2.3 million

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.880
people no after the reunification

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:02.640
everyone in Taiwan need to make a pledge

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:04.640
whether they acknowledge there is only

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.880
one China and Taiwan is part of China

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:09.279
and if they don't make that pledge they

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:11.880
us those who pledge wow for the one

00:09:09.279 --> 00:09:13.079
China policy they are local you didn't

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.440
by the way you didn't say everyone you

00:09:13.079 --> 00:09:16.040
said of Japanese descent that is

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.680
literally ethnical you're picking people

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.079
by their ethnic Heritage making them do

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.480
a loyalty test otherwise they have to

00:09:19.079 --> 00:09:23.160
get out of the country they've is not a

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:24.920
loyalty test here for example in Britain

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:28.399
if you are a British citizen you need to

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:29.760
support the monarchy you cannot say I no

00:09:28.399 --> 00:09:31.360
I'm standing in Britain don't support

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.800
the monarchy I don't like King Charles

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.360
no you cannot say no I just said it m I

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:37.600
literally just said it you cannot take

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.920
any action to oppose the monarchy system

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.880
but I don't have to sign a pledge saying

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:43.160
I support King Charles well each country

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:45.760
is different we are talking about China

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.440
China is very and China has one policy

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.560
which is part of the Constitution

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.880
involves people in Taiwan who don't want

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.399
to be part of your country let's bring

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.720
in our panel who are waiting to come in

00:09:52.399 --> 00:09:55.600
and join let's see what they think I'm

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.800
joined by Steven uh Chan professor at

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.839
the University of London School of

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:01.079
Oriental and African studies um if

00:09:58.839 --> 00:10:03.200
you're in Taiwan today how worried are

00:10:01.079 --> 00:10:04.920
you about Al looming Invasion I'm not in

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.000
Taiwan today I'm going to be visiting

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:10.120
next year I've been there five times in

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.040
all of the great cities of Taiwan and

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.959
what I've noticed most conspicuously is

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:17.120
that nobody I've talked to wants to

00:10:13.959 --> 00:10:19.600
rejoin or reunify with China because of

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.560
their sense of freedom and their sense

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.680
of

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.279
self-determination so I think that if

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:26.279
you're going to say our sovereignty

00:10:24.279 --> 00:10:28.480
matters more than your desire for your

00:10:26.279 --> 00:10:29.760
own self-determination and freedom then

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:32.120
you're doing something that will not

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:34.399
make you popular in Taiwan and you won't

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:37.600
win the argument for Chinese sovereignty

00:10:34.399 --> 00:10:38.440
over the island Martin uh Martin Jakes

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.880
is here with us author of the

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.320
bestselling book when China rules the

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:43.040
world Martin you've said in the past

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:46.120
that China cannot should not be seen

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:48.040
through a solely Western lens so I and I

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.600
agree with you and there's issues there

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:52.120
but I began the show by asking Victor

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.800
about Japan and India and the

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:55.800
Philippines separate Taiwan just the

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.760
issues in the region do you think China

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.680
is responsible for some of those issues

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.680
all of those issues none of those issues

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:05.000
well China is obviously involved in

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:08.200
inevitably in all of those issues um I

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.399
think that uh that actually if you look

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:14.440
at the rise of China over the last you

00:11:11.399 --> 00:11:17.720
know 30 40 years spectacular biggest

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:21.360
change we've ever seen in history really

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:24.040
and uh inevitably that is changing

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:26.200
everything in the region in the world uh

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:30.040
that doesn't but the remarkable thing

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:32.000
I'd say Med about China's R is how you

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:34.600
quoted the military figures and so on

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.279
but China has not fought any wars since

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:41.160
1979 if you compare that with America

00:11:38.279 --> 00:11:42.959
Europe Japan at the same stage of

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:45.079
development they were they were

00:11:42.959 --> 00:11:47.720
extremely aggressive um let's talk human

00:11:45.079 --> 00:11:49.360
rights Victor you've called Wagers in

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:51.600
China's shinjang Province your brothers

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:53.399
and sisters how do you feel about the

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.839
fact that at least half a million some

00:11:53.399 --> 00:11:58.000
say more of your brothers and sisters

00:11:55.839 --> 00:12:00.120
are being detained in camps by the

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Chinese government that's 5% % of the

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:04.760
adult weager population one of the

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.959
highest imprisonment detention rates in

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:10.000
the world Med the weagles are proud

00:12:07.959 --> 00:12:13.480
ethnic group one of the

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.040
56 ethnic nationalities in China The

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:18.519
Wiggles as far as I'm concerned are my

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:21.000
true brothers and sisters I know many of

00:12:18.519 --> 00:12:24.880
them I travel to Shin Jang regularly and

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:27.399
I talk to many other wigos now if anyone

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:30.519
is serious about accusing China of

00:12:27.399 --> 00:12:33.519
practicing mass in Justice to the

00:12:30.519 --> 00:12:35.079
weagles give me the evidence I think

00:12:33.519 --> 00:12:36.560
just did Human Rights Watch say half a

00:12:35.079 --> 00:12:38.480
million people detained over the years

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:40.959
in recent years you keep quote Human

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.320
Rights Watch and I tell you do you know

00:12:40.959 --> 00:12:44.440
where they got those numbers from I

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.959
don't know can I tell you I I don't know

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.440

00:12:49.399 --> 00:12:53.680
where did they get the source so their

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:55.680
source is the shinjang high people's

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.639
procurator uh which has published its

00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:00.560
own statistics shinjang official body

00:12:57.639 --> 00:13:01.920
which says it's convicted 54 4,826

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:04.720
people prosecuted in the region since

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:06.680
2017 the United Nations office for human

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:09.680
rights looked at satellite footage they

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:11.800
say 10 to 20% of the population amnesty

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.800
estimates a million people in camps half

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:16.680
a million is a conservative number many

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:18.880

lawyer you are a weager uh who Victor

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:13.000
says brothers and sisters your literal

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:15.320
brother has been held in an internment

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.639
camp in shinjang since 2016 I believe

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:19.079
rahan tell us what happened to your

00:15:17.639 --> 00:15:20.880

00:15:19.079 --> 00:15:22.199
Victor to what you've heard and what is

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:24.480
the latest on your brother if you don't

00:15:22.199 --> 00:15:25.959
mind sharing with us yeah my brother

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.560
Akbar Assad is a prominent Tech

00:15:25.959 --> 00:15:29.839
entrepreneur in fact your own media

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:32.720
Outlet called him bright star in the

00:15:29.839 --> 00:15:35.720
tech world right before his detention he

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:37.240
was invited on a state Galla dinner and

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.000
then he disappeared how could you

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:43.399
explain

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:46.680
now M again in China we have about 20

00:15:43.399 --> 00:15:50.040
Muslim ethnic groups you need to ask one

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:53.000
question why the extremism existed

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:55.639
mostly among the wial communities

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.600
because there are extremists among the

00:15:55.639 --> 00:16:00.079
wigo community who want to separate Shin

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:02.959
Jang away from your brother been

00:16:00.079 --> 00:16:04.759
convicted of any supported by CIA and

00:16:02.959 --> 00:16:06.839
other Western

00:16:04.759 --> 00:16:09.600
organizations that's the real truth hold

00:16:06.839 --> 00:16:10.959
on talk to the hazaks they don't support

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:13.399
has your brother been convicted of a

00:16:10.959 --> 00:16:15.600
crime um according to un there's no

00:16:13.399 --> 00:16:17.199
trial has taken place he just forcibly

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.000
disappeared actually it amount the en

00:16:17.199 --> 00:16:20.759
Force disappearance but according to the

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.279
Chinese government he committed a crime

00:16:20.759 --> 00:16:25.880
of inciting ethnic discrimination while

00:16:23.279 --> 00:16:28.880
he's a systematically oppressed and when

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:30.079
I challenge that decision because under

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.000
under the Chinese law if you're

00:16:30.079 --> 00:16:34.040
committed with the alleged crime that

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.639
you you have three years sentences but

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:39.160
he got 15 years how do you in justify

00:16:36.639 --> 00:16:40.959
that then they switch the crime so how

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:43.240
do you even explain this is a rule of

00:16:40.959 --> 00:16:45.480
law system you mentioned that if people

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:48.240
are not pro- independent then they're

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:50.680
fine in shinjang my brother by no means

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:53.639
is pro- independent in fact your media

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:56.480
Outlet sees daily media invited him to

00:16:53.639 --> 00:16:58.360
exchange information did he split the

00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:00.000
country when he visited beij you okay

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.399
with the treatment of her brother M in

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.439
front of this very Augusto body let me

00:17:02.399 --> 00:17:07.959
make several very brief points the real

00:17:05.439 --> 00:17:10.520
crime involved by some of the wigo

00:17:07.959 --> 00:17:13.079
people are agitating for shinjang

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:16.720
Independence they violate the one China

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:19.280
policy Now set separate from that you

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:21.079
know different communities May F find

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:25.039
their own different problems which need

00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:26.319
to be sorted out in the cuse of Law and

00:17:25.039 --> 00:17:28.600
I hope but our brother's been detained

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:31.360
for eight years well I did not know the

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:33.720
ch I hope I can help you to really look

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:37.039
at the case at the accusation against

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:40.039
him I hope your brother is not guilty of

00:17:37.039 --> 00:17:43.840
inciting for separatism of Shing Jang if

00:17:40.039 --> 00:17:46.480
that is the case then let the law take

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:48.840
its CA well your media out that called

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:51.080
him a model citizen who is a promoter of

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:52.919
ethnic unity in sh have you been able to

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:54.440
speak to your brother or no not at all

00:17:52.919 --> 00:17:58.000
like you know for eight years he's

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:59.919
forcibly disappeared um up until like

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.960
last months for the first time my

00:17:59.919 --> 00:18:04.480
parents saw him what kind of justice

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:06.360
system is that you're making a mockery

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:08.600
you're not just detaining them Victor

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:10.440
they're being tortured numerous

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:12.080
testimonies the UN has collected are you

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.520
okay with that M when you talk about

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:16.679
torture think about Guantanamo Bay

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:20.400
prison oh my word rather than in Shin

00:18:16.679 --> 00:18:21.880
Jang Shin Jang is a place of great peace

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:24.120
and

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:25.559
stability hold on Victor the accounts of

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.840

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:40.600

bring in Martin Jake Martin when you

00:19:32.679 --> 00:19:36.480
hear people say basically there's no

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:38.280
torture everyone's making it up there's

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:40.880
nobody in detention come on that's

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:42.919
ridiculous is it not Martin well I mean

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:45.960
I don't know all the details of the

00:19:42.919 --> 00:19:48.919
situation in ch Shin Jang but clearly

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:52.080
there's been a big problem for a long

00:19:48.919 --> 00:19:54.480
time in Shin Jang in terms of the

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:59.280
relationship between the weer and the

00:19:54.480 --> 00:20:02.159
Han and that came to a head in 2009

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:05.480
when there was a demonstration and 200

00:20:02.159 --> 00:20:08.799
people were killed by by the weer then

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:11.880
the Chinese Chinese inflicted the same

00:20:08.799 --> 00:20:14.360
kind of damage on the so this is not

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:16.720
this is this is a deep problem in my

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:18.360
view and it's not easily passed up

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:22.120
there's no other problem in China of

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:23.360
this kind yeah but people consider

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:25.600
that's a pretty big problem it's a very

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:29.360
big problem for them yeah and I do the

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:31.240
other thing bet I'd say is that um um

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:33.400
the point that's being made about

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:37.280
separatism is true that I think that

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:39.600
what the 30 million Muslims in China the

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:42.200
ha is the biggest single minority they

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:44.280
have they are completely integrated but

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:47.240
the problem the problem is shin Jang is

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:49.200
clearly the issue of separatism Stephen

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:50.679
let me ask you this question Victor's

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.480
making a lot of promises tonight about

00:20:50.679 --> 00:20:54.320
me going to shinjang and rean going to

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:58.720
Shin everyone's going to be

00:20:54.320 --> 00:21:00.840
fine how how safe how okay are you with

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:03.520
visiting China how how free do you think

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:05.240
you are when you go to China when I go

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:07.360
to China and I haven't been for some

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:10.880
time I'm watched almost

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:14.279
247 there's always someone I can spot is

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:16.880
trailing me so I know when my hotel room

00:21:14.279 --> 00:21:20.320
is upgraded suddenly to a spacious Suite

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:22.080
I'm now in a place which is bugged so

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:24.440
someone who's a mild critic and a

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:28.200
scholarly critic like me doesn't feel

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:31.559
safe in China by contrast I feel safer

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:33.880
in time iwan Victor when you hear Steven

00:21:31.559 --> 00:21:35.679
say he doesn't feel that safe going to

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:38.159
China prefers going to Taiwan when we

00:21:35.679 --> 00:21:40.200
talk about freedom of speech for example

00:21:38.159 --> 00:21:42.159
in China I live in the United States of

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:44.240
America where I can say that Donald

00:21:42.159 --> 00:21:46.080
Trump is a I don't know hypothetically

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:48.120
an orang faed

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:50.440

their government to talk about President

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:05.679
Xi Jinping in that way you can't say

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.840
anything like you wouldn't dare say

00:22:05.679 --> 00:22:08.240

Hall and a live audience who we're going

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:55.960
to hear from shortly Victor before we

00:23:53.039 --> 00:23:58.880
get to the audience in 2019 on this very

00:23:55.960 --> 00:24:01.320
show I asked the question is she being

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:03.720
gearing up to be president for Life

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:06.320
dictator in Chief I mean he's the most

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:08.440
powerful leader of China since Ma he's

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:10.320
abolished presidential term limits he's

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:12.559
now in his third five-year term as

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:15.600
president so I'll ask again tonight is

00:24:12.559 --> 00:24:18.440
he now president for Life a true

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:20.640
dictator for the record first of all

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:23.320
Chinese president XI jining will never

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:26.120
be president for Life there will be a

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:28.559
time limit when it will be will be

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:30.880
handled according to the Chinese legal

00:24:28.559 --> 00:24:34.120
system and Constitution secondly there

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:36.320
is no dictator in China why because

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:39.799
dictatorship simply doesn't work

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:42.520
democracy means modernization and how

00:24:39.799 --> 00:24:45.600
can you explain profound transformation

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:47.520
of China over the past 45 years in China

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:50.720
if you have dictatorship or

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:53.399
authoritarian rule no every leader in

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:56.039
China will be put into a team and

00:24:53.399 --> 00:24:58.679
teamwork will be much more important

00:24:56.039 --> 00:25:01.440
than individualism Victor maybe previous

00:24:58.679 --> 00:25:03.520
president did maybe Jang zamin or huin

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:05.760
everyone knows xiin ping has centralized

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:07.440
power Consolidated power got rid of term

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.640
limits you say there's a way to get rid

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:10.559
of him but there isn't actually a legal

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:12.399
way to get rid of him he's in power for

00:25:10.559 --> 00:25:15.080
life and he likes being a dictator why

00:25:12.399 --> 00:25:16.799
are we pretending Med allow me to remind

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:18.799
you the Communist Party of China which

00:25:16.799 --> 00:25:22.120
is the ruling party of China has a

00:25:18.799 --> 00:25:24.640
membership of up to 100 million people

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:27.159
it's well structured every Province

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:29.200
every state owned Enterprise Etc will

00:25:27.159 --> 00:25:30.720
have a part cell

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:33.320
there's no division or debate within the

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:37.159
Chinese Communist Party listen to me no

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:40.919
single person in China can dictate to a

00:25:37.159 --> 00:25:42.720
population of 1.4 billion people and 100

00:25:40.919 --> 00:25:44.080
million membership of the Communist

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:45.960
Party of China okay let's test that

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:47.799
that's a mission impossible Let's test

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:49.919
that proposition the president won a

00:25:47.799 --> 00:25:53.120
vote last year won a vote I'll put that

00:25:49.919 --> 00:25:54.720
in air quotes do you know the tally of

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:56.600
last year's presidential vote in favor

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:59.080
of Xi Jinping by the national people's

00:25:56.600 --> 00:26:01.200
Congress part of that structure you just

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:03.760
advertised to us what was the vote can

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:08.080
you tell our audience here I think it's

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:11.919
up to about 100% that doesn't

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:14.200
2,952 to zero yes that's exactly what I

00:26:11.919 --> 00:26:16.600
said could you not find a few people

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:19.440
just to make it look a little even one

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:21.679
or two many it's not surprising it's not

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:25.000
surprising 2952 to

00:26:21.679 --> 00:26:27.480
zero one R the Chinese system everyone

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.480
supports the Chinese president that's

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:31.919
you just told us 10 seconds ago there's

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:32.919
this huge system a big party one guy and

00:26:31.919 --> 00:26:35.399
then you're like oh no but everyone

00:26:32.919 --> 00:26:38.799
supports him zero votes against him one

00:26:35.399 --> 00:26:42.480
person out of 3,000 couldn't say she

00:26:38.799 --> 00:26:45.760
jining not my guy one what if he is the

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:48.120
guy for all the Communist Party of China

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:49.960
you never know know well if that's the

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:51.120
case then your entire first answer is

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:52.799
redundant because it doesn't matter if

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:55.440
there's 100 million people they all have

00:26:52.799 --> 00:26:57.880
to follow the leader no he does command

00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:00.559
huge respect among the Chinese people as

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:01.840
well as you say respect I say fear do

00:27:00.559 --> 00:27:03.799
you know how many names were on the

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:05.760
ballot papers that were given in

00:27:03.799 --> 00:27:06.679
2013 how many names were on the ballot

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:08.720
paper when they went to choose the

00:27:06.679 --> 00:27:10.840
president can you tell our audience I

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:12.440
think there is only one candidate yeah

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:15.120
there were no no no other

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:17.159
names that's a real that's a real secure

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:19.320
leader a guy who knows he has the

00:27:17.159 --> 00:27:20.880
confidence of his people you get to vote

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:22.679
but only for me and none of you can

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:25.080
actually vote against me would you not

00:27:22.679 --> 00:27:28.399
want to end up in a situation with six

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:31.640
prime ministers in 8 years yeah so you

00:27:28.399 --> 00:27:33.720
prefer a dictatorship no we prefer a

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:35.320
system that works for the benefit of the

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:37.159
Chinese people I I have not said a word

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:39.600
about what works or not you got great

00:27:37.159 --> 00:27:42.519
economic growth look at the

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:44.440
dictatorship there is no dictatorship M

00:27:42.519 --> 00:27:46.720
you just admitted that there's no name

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:48.600
on the ballot paper no votes against him

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:51.640
and they all just follow him that's the

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:53.600
dictatorship Med when you have a say by

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:55.559
name multiple times after but it's a

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:58.200
dictator how many candidates are there

00:27:55.559 --> 00:28:00.640
on the ballot paper how many what king

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:02.360
Queen when the king succeeds the queen

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:04.360
how many candidates are there on the

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:06.799
ballet paper how many how many does that

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:08.559
make Britain not a democracy well you're

00:28:06.799 --> 00:28:09.919
asking the wrong guy I'm a republican so

00:28:08.559 --> 00:28:11.480
I think we should be a full democracy

00:28:09.919 --> 00:28:13.279
and get rid of the monarchy and I can

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:15.159
say that here you can't say that in

00:28:13.279 --> 00:28:16.399
China you cannot take any action against

00:28:15.159 --> 00:28:17.760
that yes I can actually I can go out on

00:28:16.399 --> 00:28:19.360
the street I can hold up a placard and

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:20.720
say let's get rid of King Charles I can

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:22.480
create a whole protest outside

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:24.120
Buckingham Palace you can't do that in

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:25.919
China you can't even put one other

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:28.279
person's name on a ballot paper that's

00:28:25.919 --> 00:28:31.120
how insecure Your Leader is I'm I'm a

00:28:28.279 --> 00:28:33.039
lawyer in my capacity as a lawyer I can

00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:35.840
give you a long list of things that you

00:28:33.039 --> 00:28:37.320
cannot do regarding the monarchy here in

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:38.919
I'm not debating that I'm saying that we

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:40.480
have an elected government we get to

00:28:38.919 --> 00:28:44.840
choose we get to swap six Prime

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:46.760
Ministers God help us but we get to pick

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:49.320
everyone in this room who's a citizen

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:51.120
gets to pick listen you end up with your

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:52.960
mini budget which bankrupt the whole

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:54.559
country that's an honest answer Victor

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:57.440
but Victor I admire that because that's

00:28:54.559 --> 00:28:59.279
an honest answer your answer is it's a

00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:01.559
dictatorship that works at least say

00:28:59.279 --> 00:29:03.559
that no no no you can't you keep dodging

00:29:01.559 --> 00:29:04.720
one minute you say it's not a doip then

00:29:03.559 --> 00:29:07.720
I show you it is you say but it's

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:10.120
working we've got growth my pick one myy

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:12.279
if that is your point I will seriously

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:14.000
urge you to do more homework about how

00:29:12.279 --> 00:29:15.360
the Chinese system works okay let's talk

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.559
about the Chinese system because I did a

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:18.399
little bit of homework a little bit of

00:29:16.559 --> 00:29:21.960
homework it's it's it's did you know

00:29:18.399 --> 00:29:24.480
that Xi Jinping put his name in the

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:26.399
Constitution that's weird well the

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:27.840
leader of the country put his own name

00:29:26.399 --> 00:29:29.679
in the Constitution while he's president

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:31.720
no has done that since Ma none of the

00:29:29.679 --> 00:29:33.360
other Chinese presidents not huin taau

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:35.600
not your old boss Deng Xiao ping none of

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:38.559
them did it did they or am I wrong it's

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:41.120
wrong uh did the Chinese Constitution

00:29:38.559 --> 00:29:43.080
has been most frequently amended

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:45.039
compared with any other country am I

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:47.760
wrong about what I just said with my

00:29:45.039 --> 00:29:49.559
name was put into the Constitution I D's

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:52.640
name was put into the while he was

00:29:49.559 --> 00:29:53.840
president and J's name was put into the

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.559
not while they were sitting presidents

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.519
and you know that tell our crowd here

00:29:55.559 --> 00:29:58.159
not while they were president they

00:29:56.519 --> 00:30:00.840
didn't do it themselves according to

00:29:58.159 --> 00:30:03.000
recollection each of were put into the

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:05.720
cons while they were while the leaders

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.120
were still alive okay so I'm right not

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:09.279
while they were president I love the

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:11.159
little slip even Donald Trump one of the

00:30:09.279 --> 00:30:13.320
great narcissists of our time has not

00:30:11.159 --> 00:30:15.600
proposed yet putting his name into the

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:17.799
US Constitution if you are the president

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:20.080
of China you're elected without any

00:30:17.799 --> 00:30:22.120
opponents no names on the ballot paper

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:24.480
zero votes against you you put your name

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:26.399
in the Constitution six-year-olds are

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:28.200
taught about Xi Jinping thought in

00:30:26.399 --> 00:30:29.640
primary school that is not just the

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:31.799
dictatorship that is a cult of

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:34.000
personality I don't think China believes

00:30:31.799 --> 00:30:35.799
in personal uh so why are six-year-olds

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.240
learning about Xi Jinping thought I'm

00:30:35.799 --> 00:30:40.360
pretty sure no six-year-olds learned

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:43.320
about Liz truss's mini

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:46.159
budget Victor the Chinese system is such

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:48.679
that once you Orient the country in One

00:30:46.159 --> 00:30:50.440
Direction everyone follows the suit do

00:30:48.679 --> 00:30:52.159
they follow or they ordered to follow

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:54.919
they don't follow out a choice no it's

00:30:52.159 --> 00:30:57.120
like a vehicle with four wheels here you

00:30:54.919 --> 00:31:00.200
have four wheels aligned in different

00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:03.279
directions in directions in China the

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:05.080
four wheels of a car all lined up in One

00:31:03.279 --> 00:31:07.000
Direction They Don't going forward they

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:09.120
don't Victor let me give you an example

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.840
former for the Chinese way former

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:13.000
foreign minister chin gang was removed

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:15.080
from his post and has not been seen in

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.720
public since June 2023 a few months

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:18.639
later China's defense minister General

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:20.000
Lee Shang Fu disappeared from public

00:31:18.639 --> 00:31:21.840
view for months has now been expelled

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.320
from the party accused of corruption

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:25.679
that's at least two ministers that

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:27.960
disappeared just in the last year with

00:31:25.679 --> 00:31:29.720
apologies to Oscar wild to lose one

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:31.960
Minister might be unfortunate to lose

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:34.360
two is careless is it not do you know

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:36.760
the point I want to make this means

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:38.960
China is really merciless in dealing

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:40.760
with Corruption of all kinds even among

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:42.720
the foreign minister and defense Min

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:44.880
imagine Anthony blinkin and Lloyd Austin

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:45.919
just disappeared tomorrow we don't know

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:48.399
where they are we've never seen them

00:31:45.919 --> 00:31:50.240
again that's not normal Victor listen

00:31:48.399 --> 00:31:51.600
corruption is rampant how do we know

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.919
they're corrupt they just disappeared

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:56.360
where's the

00:31:52.919 --> 00:31:58.880
trial the tri finish my point Corruption

00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:00.720
of all kinds in China need to be dwelt

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:01.880
with so where's the trial mercilessness

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:03.399
so where's the trial where's the trial

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:06.080
of the former for is we don't even know

00:32:03.399 --> 00:32:08.159
where he is many those things you don't

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:09.720
know doesn't mean doesn't happen where

00:32:08.159 --> 00:32:12.080
is the trial for this man you're just

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:14.000
accusing of corruption Chang was my good

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:16.960
friend for more than 20 years where is

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.960
he then he is involved in corruption

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:21.600
where is he and he is dwelt with very

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:22.679
swiftly where is he Victor regardless of

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:25.159
your good friend you don't know where he

00:32:22.679 --> 00:32:26.840
is regardless of where is the for

00:32:25.159 --> 00:32:27.919
foreign minister of China this is not a

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:29.919
hard question we're not asking where

00:32:27.919 --> 00:32:31.240
Ran's brother in the middle of shin Jang

00:32:29.919 --> 00:32:33.399
is that you can dodge where is the

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:34.799
former foreign minister of China who

00:32:33.399 --> 00:32:36.279
disappeared and by the way he wasn't

00:32:34.799 --> 00:32:37.760
accused of corruption the spokesman came

00:32:36.279 --> 00:32:39.360
out and said he has health reasons then

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:41.240
corruption came later by the way where

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:43.200
did he go your friend that means there

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:44.880
is a process and the process the process

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:47.159
starts with one lie that he's ill and

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:49.000
then the next lie is he's corrupt he may

00:32:47.159 --> 00:32:50.120
be ill you never know I mean he's

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.159
probably ill after he's been in a

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:55.919
Chinese prison may be ill now you never

00:32:52.159 --> 00:32:57.880
know but at least gong lost his job

00:32:55.919 --> 00:32:59.559
because of his corruption last question

00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:01.960
that's the point where is he he's

00:32:59.559 --> 00:33:05.200
somewhere in China you will never see

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:06.679
him he is among the 1.4 billion people

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:08.200
no it's not just him there's many other

00:33:06.679 --> 00:33:09.639
people who have disappeared the previous

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:11.200
defense minister disappeared the

00:33:09.639 --> 00:33:12.519
ministry of industry and Technology

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:14.120
disappeared the former Interpol

00:33:12.519 --> 00:33:15.600
president disappeared in China you just

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:17.480
disappear if they don't like you that's

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:19.480
the rule of law in China I'm so happy

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:21.519
they disappear because if they keep

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:23.279
doing their job they will bring greater

00:33:21.519 --> 00:33:24.639
dis be careful what you wish for cuz

00:33:23.279 --> 00:33:26.399
everyone's watching this show and if you

00:33:24.639 --> 00:33:28.840
get something wrong tonight maybe you

00:33:26.399 --> 00:33:30.000
disappear if I is a beer I hope you will

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:32.600
bail me

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.639
out I'd have to find you first and China

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.440
is apparently a big country um I want to

00:33:34.639 --> 00:33:37.559
bring in uh Steven Chan professor at the

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:39.559
University of London's School of

00:33:37.559 --> 00:33:42.120
Oriental African studies um Stephen XI

00:33:39.559 --> 00:33:43.799
jinping's policies his Crackdown on

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:45.960
dissident I mean China was never a

00:33:43.799 --> 00:33:47.760
democracy other presidents were also

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:49.559
dictatorial but can we agree that

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:50.960
xinping is on a different level when it

00:33:49.559 --> 00:33:52.240
comes to repression at home the

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.919
consolidation of power I assume you

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:55.760
disagree with Victor's description of

00:33:53.919 --> 00:33:57.240
him as part of a I don't know four-wheel

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:59.639
car all driving in the same Direction

00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:02.639
Happily he certainly Consolidated his

00:33:59.639 --> 00:34:04.399
power he is a very very strong president

00:34:02.639 --> 00:34:07.000
and I think that the real test of all of

00:34:04.399 --> 00:34:09.639
this is how China has treated Hong Kong

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.280
with the increasing clampdown on dissent

00:34:09.639 --> 00:34:14.240
and free expression of opinion when they

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:16.599
were meant to have a degree of freedom

00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:19.359
in a one country two system way of

00:34:16.599 --> 00:34:22.839
approaching life we can't see any

00:34:19.359 --> 00:34:25.200
evidence of vibrant debate in China and

00:34:22.839 --> 00:34:26.800
I note that one of the great

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:29.679
disappointments of my life is when I

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:32.679
read Chinese acad mic works everyone TOS

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:34.679
a party line no one does independent

00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:37.079
research to publish as it were anything

00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:39.200
critical of for instance not just Gan

00:34:37.079 --> 00:34:41.839
ping anything critical about Chinese

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:44.159
foreign policy or they might disappear

00:34:41.839 --> 00:34:45.679
they might not get promoted in any case

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:47.040
rahan assat is a senior fellow at the

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:48.839
Atlantic Council international human

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:50.839
rights law rahan in part one we' talked

00:34:48.839 --> 00:34:52.240
in depth about uh the repression against

00:34:50.839 --> 00:34:55.399
the weers and your own personal

00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:57.839
situation in 2014 Xi Jinping privately

00:34:55.399 --> 00:34:59.800
called for an allout struggle quote

00:34:57.839 --> 00:35:02.200
against terrorism and to show absolutely

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:03.599
no mercy after a visit to shinjang how

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:05.520
much do you believe Xi Jinping is

00:35:03.599 --> 00:35:07.040
driving what's happening in Shin Jang

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:09.119
how much do you think he's responsible

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:11.040
for the repression in China well the

00:35:09.119 --> 00:35:13.599
matter of the fact is that all of it

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:15.440
happened under current Administration

00:35:13.599 --> 00:35:17.520
right so many scholars are attributing

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:21.680
to him it happened under his Reign he's

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:23.720
the one who said absolutely no mercy um

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:25.839
stamping out roots and branches of the

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:27.800
ERS breaking out their connection and

00:35:25.839 --> 00:35:31.119
these are the policies implemented under

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:33.240
his leadership so it's very hard to

00:35:31.119 --> 00:35:35.400
separate XI Jin ping from the current

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:36.720
policy shinan Martin Jake's author of

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:39.400
the best selling book when China rules

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:41.520
the world you you heard Victor talk

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:42.960
about well we can't be a dictatorship

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.640
because we're doing so well the economy

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:46.960
is doing amazing we don't have Liz trust

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:49.000
mini budgets Etc but then you get into

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:51.119
the debate about can dictatorship and

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.319
growth coexist do you need to have

00:35:51.119 --> 00:35:55.480
democracy to go alongside that and I

00:35:53.319 --> 00:35:57.040
think about the pandemic Martin and I

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:59.599
think about China's reaction to the

00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:00.839
pandemic is that where the dictatorship

00:35:59.599 --> 00:36:02.880
the lack of transparency the

00:36:00.839 --> 00:36:04.440
disappearances caught up with China

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:06.079
because of course there was a black hole

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:08.560
in China in terms of China's censorship

00:36:06.079 --> 00:36:11.119
methods its Draconian policies the zero

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:12.680
Co policy the Crackdown which led some

00:36:11.119 --> 00:36:14.839
people say to over a million two million

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:16.800
deaths we saw protests in buildings

00:36:14.839 --> 00:36:18.480
people screaming was that a moment where

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:20.920
China actually collided with reality and

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:23.319
said this system it it can't survive

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:25.800
longterm well I beg to differ okay on

00:36:23.319 --> 00:36:30.599
the question of the pandemic because

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:33.760
actually for two years uh uh uh 2020 and

00:36:30.599 --> 00:36:37.680
2021 actually China did under the

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:39.800
circumstances extremely well and Well

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:42.000
outperformed the West and the reasons

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:43.800
for it are quite complicated uh you've

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.800
got to take into a very different kind

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:49.160
of system now one of the problems with

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:53.200
the discussion I think uh uh so far on

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:55.119
this question is that uh the country it

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:58.280
sounds as if the country doesn't work if

00:36:55.119 --> 00:37:01.599
you say dictator despot all these

00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:04.560
I but if and and you say not you

00:37:01.599 --> 00:37:07.040
personally but and one says there's no

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:09.000
discussion this is I think this is

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:11.079
absolutely untrue so what we're

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.760
presenting here is not an accurate

00:37:11.079 --> 00:37:14.119
picture we've got it's not about

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:15.800
accurate picture it's about balance

00:37:14.119 --> 00:37:18.319
right so I I don't deny what you're

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:19.800
saying but you're British you would

00:37:18.319 --> 00:37:21.040
think it was a political earthquake if

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:22.319
the foreign secretary and the defense

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:24.119
secretary disappeared in the space of

00:37:22.319 --> 00:37:25.760
six months not arrested disappeared

00:37:24.119 --> 00:37:27.680
surely yeah yeah and and there is

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:30.040
something on look Ching gong was was a

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:31.920
friend of mine as well and I don't know

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:35.040
what's happened to him and I think it is

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:38.000
odd certainly to our eyes it's we weird

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:40.640
that this can happen but uh but I think

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.640
that the thing is that we've got to try

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:45.800
and get Beyond cardboard cutouts when

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:49.400
we're talking about China and understand

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:51.200
how it really works okay um let's bring

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:52.880
in our audience who've been waiting here

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:55.000
in London's Conway Hall I'm going to go

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:57.800

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.480
row yes you

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:02.680
my question is as a disident from Hong

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:05.880
Kong knowing that I cannot express

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:08.240
freely in Hong Kong or in the UK without

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:10.040
risking other people in trouble I also

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:12.520
know that you just now made claims about

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:13.880
there's free speech in China and it's

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:16.319
possible to criticize the Chinese

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:18.400
government just now again can you please

00:38:16.319 --> 00:38:20.480
demonstrate that free speech and tell us

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:22.280
what are siin Ping's two worst mistakes

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:23.800
in the past five years great question if

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:25.319
you can demonstrate to us that it's okay

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:27.640
to criticize shping the Chinese

00:38:25.319 --> 00:38:29.480
government and China or even just say

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:31.400
she kind of resembles winning the Poo

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:33.079
will be good enough for me thank you

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:36.359
Victor do you want to take that question

00:38:33.079 --> 00:38:40.200
well thank you I would say uh China need

00:38:36.359 --> 00:38:43.280
to make more prompt uh take more prompt

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:45.079
actions in dealing with the dramatic uh

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:47.960
aging population in China and the

00:38:45.079 --> 00:38:49.240
dramatic uh demographic decline do you

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:51.280
think XI Jin Ping's to blame for not

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:53.319
being fast enough on Aging no I think uh

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:56.640
the whole Chinese government including

00:38:53.319 --> 00:38:58.720
the Central Committee State council

00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:02.800
local government need to take actions

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:05.359
quickly to reverse that dramatic uh

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:06.599
aging population problem and demographic

00:39:05.359 --> 00:39:08.359
we're not going to get a criticism out

00:39:06.599 --> 00:39:09.560
of VI let's go back to the audience uh

00:39:08.359 --> 00:39:13.200
let's go to the gentleman here in the

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:16.880
tie yes you yeah Alex sorry Alex Vin

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:19.800
some chatam house my my question is uh

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:22.079
debt so there's been very bad riots for

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:24.440
example it's been in the news in Kenya

00:39:22.079 --> 00:39:27.240
some of that debt that's causing the

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:31.520
problem is owed to China so the question

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:35.839
is is how is China uh going to handle

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:38.640
the increasing uh pressures for debt

00:39:35.839 --> 00:39:41.160
cancellation uh at least 17 African

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:43.000
countries are in particular distress

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:47.079
this year thank

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:49.800
you I understand the Chinese debt in

00:39:47.079 --> 00:39:52.280
these large scale uh connectivity

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:54.599
projects is only a small portion of the

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:57.480
overall national debt because they own

00:39:54.599 --> 00:39:59.760
debt to the United States to Britain to

00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:03.280
the international uh financing uh

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:05.720
institutions Etc they not just own debt

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:08.319
to China but to many other countries

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:10.319
that's the reality secondly there is

00:40:08.319 --> 00:40:13.200
accusation about the death trap which is

00:40:10.319 --> 00:40:15.359
completely wrong and false because if

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:18.280
you want to do connectivity project

00:40:15.359 --> 00:40:21.400
major project finance things you need to

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:25.000
have Equity as well as debt debt is an

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:26.920
indispensable part of the packaging okay

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.079
let's go back to the audience um I Sate

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:29.720
this gentlemen the time then go to the

00:40:28.079 --> 00:40:32.280
back then we go to that gentleman there

00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:35.680
you next after this

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:37.640
one my name is Sonam frazzi I would like

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:40.599
to ask you a question on

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:43.880
Tibet I was born in Tibet before the

00:40:40.599 --> 00:40:48.119
Chinese invasion of Tibet unfortunately

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:49.680
1.2 million Tibetans have died since and

00:40:48.119 --> 00:40:54.280
we have been made

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:57.440
refugees my question is Tibet after 74

00:40:54.280 --> 00:41:01.200
years of Chinese rule is still under

00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:05.119
lockdown no journalists no individual

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:07.960
tourists no even Tibetans are not

00:41:05.119 --> 00:41:11.720
allowed to see their families what is

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:14.200
China afraid of to keep keep Tibet in

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:17.040
such a tight control and Tibetans is

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:20.920
such a inhuman existence in our own

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:23.400
country sir ever since the UN Dynasty if

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:25.960
not even earlier Tibet has been part of

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:27.920
China through different dynasties

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:30.520
different historical period

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:34.079
I can assure you during your lifetime

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:36.720
and mine Tibet will always be part of

00:41:34.079 --> 00:41:38.079
China why are you so insistent on ruling

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:40.720
places that don't want to be ruled by

00:41:38.079 --> 00:41:43.040
China no Tibet we've been through Tibet

00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:45.400
Taiwan they're not happy in

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:47.200
shinjang Tibet being part of China

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:49.839
doesn't depend on whether you like it or

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:52.160
not it's a mega trend of our time a mega

00:41:49.839 --> 00:41:54.560
Trend and you need to accept that before

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:57.839
you will feel free to go back to

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:58.839
China visit Tibet

00:41:57.839 --> 00:42:01.680
you sound like you're threatening the

00:41:58.839 --> 00:42:03.960
man no I'm not he said you have to

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:06.079
accept that before you can go back he's

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:07.640
from that place you live in peace in

00:42:06.079 --> 00:42:09.440
Britain that's good but he's a refugee

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:11.960
but if you want to go back to Tibet

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:13.880
acknowledge Tibet is part of China

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:16.560
period And what if he doesn't he can't

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:19.400
go back to his home you cannot go

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:22.640
back because China doesn't want to see

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:25.240
anyone advocating for the independence

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:29.040
of Tibet why can't no way there will

00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:32.160
that will never happen Victor why can't

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:34.319
China rest on its own merits why the

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:36.960
bullying and the threats we're going to

00:42:34.319 --> 00:42:39.079
break you to pieces Taiwan you can't go

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:41.480
back until you sign this document or

00:42:39.079 --> 00:42:43.599
that declar why the insecurity second

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:46.760
biggest economy in the world major power

00:42:43.599 --> 00:42:48.960
you sound so insecure China security

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:51.359
rests on the principle that there is

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:53.680
only one China and Taiwan is part of

00:42:51.359 --> 00:42:56.280
China Tibet is part of China and Shing

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:57.359
Jang is part of China period And even if

00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:58.839
the people there don't want to be part

00:42:57.359 --> 00:43:00.599
of it you don't give a damn the majority

00:42:58.839 --> 00:43:03.240
of the people live happily as Chinese

00:43:00.599 --> 00:43:05.240
ciens did you do a vote I will go with

00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:07.200

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:10.520
can go to Tibet but the guy who's from

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:12.079
there can't go there you sound ludicrous

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:13.480
